###Heroes of the Storm Companion App

HOTSpot is a companion app for players of Blizzard's Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game 'Heroes Of The Storm'.  The app currently allows players two different kinds of functionality: a random game generator, and a tool for accessing the player's MMR (Match Making Ratio) for the various game types.

The game generator creates a random or semi-random (depending on the user's preference) set of two, five hero teams and a map.  Users can select whichever heroes they want to appear on Team A/Team B as well as the game map, or leave the game completely random.  The generator also allows users to customize the randomness of the game in two additional ways.  The 'Team Restrictive' switch will guarantee that the same hero will not appear twice in the same team (similar to the rules of a Quick Match).  The 'Global Restrictive' switch will guarantee that the same hero will not appear twice between both teams (similar to the rules of Hero League or Team League).  

The MMR tool uses the Hotslogs API to gather a user's calculated (not actual) MMR numbers for Quick Match, Hero League, Team League, 
and Unranked Draft.  All that is required is that the user enters their Blizzard tag and associated number.
